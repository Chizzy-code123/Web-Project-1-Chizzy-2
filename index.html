    <h2>A Website About Animation</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      This Website is all about animation. It will be explaining how animation is created,
      it's history and different types of animation.

    <h4>What is Animation?</h4>
    <p>
      <u>Animation</u> is a filmmaking technique whereby still images are manipulated
      to create moving images. In <i>traditional animation</i>, images are drawn or
      painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and
      exhibited on film. Animation has been recognized as an artistic medium,
      specifically within the entertainment industry. Many animations are either
      traditional animations or computer animations made with <b>computer-generated</b>
      imagery aka. <mark>CGI</mark>. Stop motion animation, in particular claymation, is also
      prominent alongside these other forms.
      Animation is contrasted with live action, although the two do not exist in
      isolation. Many filmmakers have produced films that are a hybrid of the
      two. As CGI increasingly approximates photographic imagery, filmmakers can
      relatively easily composite 3D animated visual effects (VFX) into their
      film, rather than using practical effects.
