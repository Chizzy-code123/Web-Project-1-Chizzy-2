      <h3>What is Animation? &#x1F3AC;</h3>
      <p>
        <u>Animation</u> is a filmmaking technique whereby still images are
        manipulated to create moving images. In <i>traditional animation</i>,
        images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to
        be photographed and exhibited on film. Animation has been recognized as
        an artistic medium, specifically within the entertainment industry. Many
        animations are either traditional animations or computer animations.
        Computer animations can be animated in 3D or 2D while using different
        techniques. Stop motion animation, in particular claymation, is also
        prominent alongside these other forms. Animation is contrasted with live
        action, although the two do not exist in isolation. Many filmmakers have
        produced films that are a hybrid of the two. As CGI increasingly
        approximates photographic imagery, filmmakers can relatively easily
        composite 3D animated visual effects (VFX) into their film, rather than
        using practical effects.

      <h3>How 3D Movie Animations Are Made</h3>
      <p>
        Movie animations can be animated in numerous ways such as 2D, 3D,
        hand-drawn or Stop motion by different techniques. Animators animate 3D
        animations by making a 3D model on softwares like
        <sup>Blender, Maya, 3ds Max, or Cinema 4D</sup> then undergoing a
        process called <b>rigging</b>. Next,
        <mark>keyframe animation</mark> This is where the animator sets key
        positions or poses for the character or objectss at specific points in
        time. The computer then interpolates the frames in between to create
        smooth motion. The final step is to <b>render</b> the animation. This
        process involves generating the final images or frames of the animation
        based on the keyframes, the lighting, textures and camera angles are
        then set up and that becomes the final product.

            The art of creating movement in a two-dimensional space by
            sequencing illustrated images over time. Rooted in traditional
            hand-drawn techniques and now largely produced through digital
            tools. Used in TV shows, video games and web animations.

            <sub>3D</sub> animations made with computer softwares such as
            Blender, Maya and 3Ds Max. This type of animation allows for more
            realistic movements and perspectives. Used in video games,
            interactive websites and TV shows.
