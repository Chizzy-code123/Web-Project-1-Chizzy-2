    <h2>A Website About Animation</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      This Website is all about animation. It will be explaining how animation
      is created, it's history and different types of animation.
    </p>

    <h4>What is Animation? &#x1F3AC;</h4>
    <p>
      <u>Animation</u> is a filmmaking technique whereby still images are
      manipulated to create moving images. In <i>traditional animation</i>,
      images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be
      photographed and exhibited on film. Animation has been recognized as an
      artistic medium, specifically within the entertainment industry. Many
      animations are either traditional animations or computer animations.
      Computer animations can be animated in 3D or 2D while using different
      techniques. Stop motion animation, in particular claymation, is also
      prominent alongside these other forms. Animation is contrasted with live
      action, although the two do not exist in isolation. Many filmmakers have
      produced films that are a hybrid of the two. As CGI increasingly
      approximates photographic imagery, filmmakers can relatively easily
      composite 3D animated visual effects (VFX) into their film, rather than
      using practical effects.

    <h4>How 3D Movie Animations Are Made</h4>
    <p>
      Movie animations can be animated in numerous ways such as 2D, 3D,
      hand-drawn or Stop motion by different techniques. Animators animate 3D
      animations by making a 3D model on softwares like Blender, Maya, 3ds Max,
      or Cinema 4D then undergoing a process called <b>rigging</b>. Next,
      <mark>keyframe animation</mark> This is where the animator sets key
      positions or poses for the character or objectss at specific points in
      time. The computer then interpolates the frames in between to create
      smooth motion. The final step is to <b>render</b> the animation. This
      process involves generating the final images or frames of the animation
      based on the keyframes, the lighting, textures and camera angles are then
      set up and that becomes the final product.

          Traditional hand-drawn animation or digital 2D animation. Seen in
          cartoons, movies and animes.

        <td>
          3D animations made with computer softwares such as Blender, Maya and
          3Ds Max. This type of animation allows for more realistic movements
          and perspectives. Used in video games, interactive websites and TV
          shows.
