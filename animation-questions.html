      <p>
        This form will ask you questions about different types of animation used
        in popular shows and games as well as your preferences on different
        types of animation.
      </p>

      <!-- 
        This form will gather user's answers for each question and gather
        their preferences on animations. It SHOULD mark the answers as correct
        or incorrect but I don't know how to use JavaScript yet.

        It has an ID of "animation-questions" to uniquely identify
        the form and explain its purpose.
        
        The GET attribute tells the browser how to send the form data when the form is submitted.
          This makes the information that the user added, show up on the URL
        The script uses the GET method because we don't know how to use back-end scripting yet
